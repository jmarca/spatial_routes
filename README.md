# Express routes for Shapes PostGIS

This library condenses the routes that I am using to load my database
tables using my shapes_postgis library.

This library won't really work for anybody not running at CTMLabs at
UC Irvine, but it works okay as a demo of how to use shapes_postgis
for your db tables.
